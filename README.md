Converting Electronics symbol images to the Drawings using Turtle library

There isnâ€™t an easy method to process images and draw symbols using the turtle library directly. So, I devised a logic to first pre-process the image and extract its outline. Then, I created a function to determine the nearest neighbor in a set of points. This allows the turtle to efficiently follow these positions on the canvas, enabling fast and accurate drawing.

I have written code not only to process and draw single image. The code process multiple images and combines image processing (extracting outlines) and Turtle graphics for drawing the outlined images at specified positions on the screen.
